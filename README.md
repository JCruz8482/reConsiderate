## Purpose

Gives users a second chance

ReConsiderate is a Google Extension that aimed to reduce online harassment. 

ReConsiderate analyzes text that users input (via email, social media, etc) and when the message seems to have a negative connotation toward others, a message will pop up to remind the user to reflect on the meaning of the message and whether this is the message that they would like to delivered.
